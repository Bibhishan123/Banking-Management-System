What to run / how to check the app (quick checklist)

Ensure dependencies installed: flask, sqlalchemy, requests, beautifulsoup4, pytest (for later).
pip install flask sqlalchemy requests beautifulsoup4 pytest

Start the app:
python run.py

Create some accounts (curl / Thunder Client / Postman):
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/accounts with JSON {"name":"Alice","number":"A001","balance":100}
create several accounts so batch behavior is visible.

Run the batch calc from a Python REPL (example — run from project root):
python - <<'PY'
from app import create_app
app = create_app()
sf = app.session_factory
from app.batch_calc import total_balance_in_batches_threaded, total_balance_in_batches_async
print(total_balance_in_batches_threaded(sf, batch_size=2))
import asyncio
print(asyncio.run(total_balance_in_batches_async(sf, batch_size=2)))
PY

Optionally call fetch_interest_rates to verify scraper:
python - <<'PY'
from app.scraper import fetch_interest_rates
print(fetch_interest_rates()) # returns fallback
print(fetch_interest_rates("https://example.com"))
PY

What to check after completing app folder (before writing client/tests)

API endpoints respond (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE) and persist in db.sqlite.
Logs are being written (employee_app_logs.log).
batch_calc functions return correct totals for various batch_size.
scraper returns fallback or parsed rates without crashing.
I can next:

add an API endpoint that exposes batch totals (if you want the feature over HTTP), or
scaffold pytest tests for CRUD and batch_calc. Which should I do?
